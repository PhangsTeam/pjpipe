Installation

The easiest way to install PJPipe is via pip: ::

    pip install pjpipe

You can also install through GitHub: ::

    git clone https://github.com/PhangsTeam/pjpipe.git
    pip install -e .

Note that in both cases, You **must** also install spacepylot for PJPipe to work.
PyPI does not work with direct dependencies, so install this afterwards like: ::

   pip install git+https://github.com/ejwatkins-astro/spacepylot.git
