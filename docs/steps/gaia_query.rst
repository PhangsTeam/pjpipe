=============
GaiaQueryStep
=============

If you don't have an absolute astrometric catalog to hand, this automates grabbing
a Gaia DR3 catalogue around your target. You need to make sure your target is
resolvable, and for large sources (or far away backgrounds) you may need to bump
up the radius value.
