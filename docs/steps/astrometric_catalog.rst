AstrometricCatalogStep
======================

The final source extraction that the official pipeline performs on the images in level 3 can be suboptimal (especially
for MIRI mosaics). This provides an alternative that we find tends to work better, and will produce better absolute
astrometric matches in :doc:`AstrometricAlignStep <astrometric_align>`.
