PSFMatchingStep
===============

This step will convolve mosaics to a common resolution. You'll need to supply the convolution kernels, but this will
do the rest.

If you want to generate a kernel that can feed directly into this step, please see
`this repository <https://github.com/francbelf/jwst_kernels>`_.
